# Base repository of the Introduction to React.js Course in Platzi

¡Hello, Platzinauta!

In this repository you will find the code of all the classes of the [Curso de Introducción a React.js](https://platzi.com/reactjs). To start you just have to clone this repository (`git clone`), install your dependencies (`npm i`) and run the application (`npm start`).

The main branch(developer in this case) contains the code with which we start the course and finally the deployment of the application.

Good luck learning React! #NeverStopLearning
